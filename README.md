## Gossip-Based-Dynamic-VirtualMachine-Consolidation

A Cloud simulation tool for implementing a fully decentralised dynamic virtual machine consolidation strategy over a P2P network of physical host nodes. 

## Configuration:
Please edit VmPlacementConfig/VmPlacement.txt to congifure the simulator.


You can find more information about the implemented method in my paper below:
